# PlantDiseasePrediction
Build a Convolutional Neural Network that can accurately identify whether a plant is afflicted with a disease.


The aim of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network capable of detecting whether a plant is afflicted with a disease. 
To accomplish this goal, we will employ various layers and hyperparameters when constructing, training, and evaluating our classification model.
To implement the model, we will be utilizing TensorFlow and Keras.
