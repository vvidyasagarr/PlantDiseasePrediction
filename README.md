# PlantDiseasePrediction
Build a Convolutional Neural Network that can accurately identify whether a plant is afflicted with a disease.

To meet the projected demand of feeding over 9 billion people by 2050, food production must increase by approximately 70%. However, infectious diseases currently hinder crop yield, resulting in an average loss of 40% and up to 100% in some developing countries. The increasing availability of smartphones among crop growers worldwide, with an anticipated 5 billion smartphones by 2020, presents an opportunity to leverage this technology as a valuable tool for food-growing communities. One potential application is the utilization of machine learning and big data to develop mobile disease diagnostics, which could greatly benefit farmers.


The aim of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network capable of detecting whether a plant is afflicted with a disease. 
To accomplish this goal, we will employ various layers and hyperparameters when constructing, training, and evaluating our classification model.
To implement the model, we will be utilizing TensorFlow and Keras.
